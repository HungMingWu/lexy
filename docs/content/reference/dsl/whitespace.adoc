Facilities for skipping whitespace.

By default, lexy does not treat whitespace in any particular way and it has to be parsed just like anything else in the input.
However, as there are grammars that allow whitespace in a lot of places, it is often convenient to have it taken care of.
lexy can be instructed to handle whitespace, using either manual or automatic whitespace skipping.

Manual whitespace skipping is done using `lexy::dsl::whitespace(ws)`.
It skips zero or more of whitespace defined by `ws` and can be inserted everywhere you want to skip over whitespace.
This method is recommended where whitespace is an essential part of the grammar.
See {{< github-example email >}} or {{< github-example xml >}} for examples of manual whitespace skipping.

Automatic whitespace skipping is done by adding a `static constexpr auto whitespace` member to the root production.
This is a rule that defines default whitespace for the entire grammar, as the `ws` argument did in the manual example.
lexy then skips zero or more occurrences of whitespace after every token rule in the grammar, unless it has been manually disabled (see below).
This method is recommend where whitespace is not important and is just there to format the input nicely.
See {{< github-example tutorial >}} or {{< github-example json >}} for examples of automatic whitespace skipping.

NOTE: "Whitespace" does not mean literal whitespace characters. It can also include comments (or whatever else you want).

The manual `whitespace` overload is a rule that skips whitespace as defined by its argument.

Requires::
  * `ws` is either a {{% branch-rule %}} or a {{% docref choice %}} that does not produce any values.
  * `ws` does not contain {{% docref "lexy::dsl::p" %}} or {{% docref "lexy::dsl::recurse" %}} rule.
Parses::
  Parses {{% docref "lexy::dsl::loop" %}}`(ws | lexy::dsl::else_ >> lexy::dsl::break_)` in a context where whitespace skipping is disabled.
Errors::
  All errors raised during parsing of `ws | lexy::dsl::else_ >> lexy::dsl::break_`.
  The rule then fails if `ws` has failed; even if in a branch context.
Parse tree::
  A single token node with the {{% docref "lexy::predefined_token_kind" %}} `lexy::whitespace_token_kind` whose range covers everything consumed;
  all individual token nodes of the whitespace rules are merged into this one.
  It is only added to the parse tree if it is not empty.

For convenience, `operator|` and `operator/` are overloaded for the whitespace rule.
Here, `whitespace(a) | b` is entirely equivalent to `whitespace(a | b)`, and likewise for the other overloads.
They simply allow adding more whitespace to a rule after it has already been wrapped in `whitespace`.

TIP: Use {{% docref "lexy::dsl::ascii::space" %}} to skip all ASCII whitespace characters.

== Rule `lexy::dsl::whitespace` (automatic)

{{% interface %}}

namespace lexy::dsl
{
    constexpr _rule_ whitespace;
}

The automatic `whitespace` rule skips whitespace as it is defined in grammar.

It behaves exactly identical to the manual `whitespace(ws)` overload, where `ws` is determined as follows:

1. If automatic whitespace skipping has been disabled (e.g. by using `lexy::dsl::no_whitespace()`),
   `ws` is the rule that matches the empty string.
   As such, `whitespace` does not advance the reader.
2. If {{% docref "lexy::production_whitespace" %}} for the current production and the root production is non-void, `ws` is that rule.
   Here, the root production is determined by following any `lexy::dsl::p` or `lexy::dsl::recurse` calls backwards,
   until either the top-level production originally passed to a parse function or a production inheriting from {{% docref "lexy::token_production" %}} is reached.
   This is then the root production.
3. Otherwise (if it is `void`), `ws` is the rule that matches the empty string and `whitespace` does not advance the reader at all.

This rule is automatically parsed after every {{% token-rule %}}, a {{% docref "lexy::dsl::p" %}} or {{% docref "lexy::dsl::recurse" %}} rule that parses a production inheriting from {{% docref "lexy::token_production" %}}, or after a {{% docref "lexy::dsl::no_whitespace" %}} rule.
Note that unless whitespace has been defined, this has no effect.

{{% playground-example whitespace_comment "Comments can be whitespace too" %}}

{{% playground-example whitespace_determination "How whitespace is determined" true %}}

[NOTE]
=====
As seen in the example above, directly inside the {{% docref "lexy::token_production" %}} `inner_token_whitespace` all whitespace skipping is disabled, even if it has a `::whitespace` member.
This is because the last token rule of the production (the `')'`) would skip whitespace according to the current `::whitespace` member (`'_'`).
However, the `lexy::dsl::p` production of the parent that started the parse (`production`), also skips whitespace, but according to the `::whitespace` member of its root production (`'+'`).
As such, we would skip two different whitespaces directly after each other.

To enable whitespace skipping inside a token production, put all logic into a child production and directly and only parse that one via `lexy::dsl::p`.
Inside the child production, whitespace is skipped again, as seen by the `inner_inner` production.
=====

CAUTION: If a non-root production has a `::whitespace` member, this defines whitespace only for this current production.
Any child productions will not consider this rule, as the algorithm only considers the current production and the root production.

TIP: Use `whitespace` to skip optional whitespace at the beginning of the input.

TIP: Use {{% docref "lexy::dsl::ascii::space" %}} to skip all ASCII whitespace characters.

[#no_whitespace]
== Rule `lexy::dsl::no_whitespace`

{{% interface %}}
----
namespace lexy::dsl

    constexpr _branch-rule_ no_whitespace(_branch-rule_ auto rule);
}

`no_whitespace` is a rule that parses `rule` without automatic whitespace skipping.

(Branch) Parsing::
  Parses `rule` in a context where there is no current whitespace rule and link:#whitespace-automatic[`lexy::dsl::whitespace`] does nothing.
Errors::
  All errors raised by `rule`.
  The rule then fails if `rule` has failed.
Values::
  All values produced by `rule`.

{{% playground-example no_whitespace "Disable whitespace between two tokens" %}}

TIP: In most situations, you should prefer a {{% docref "lexy::token_production" %}} instead.
`no_whitespace` is mostly used as implementation detail for rules that should never have whitespace skipping, like {{% docref "lexy::dsl::delimited" %}}.

CAUTION: When `r` contains a {{% docref "lexy::dsl::p" %}} or {{% docref "lexy::dsl::recurse" %}} rule, whitespace skipping is re-enabled while parsing the production.
