[#minus]
== Token rule `lexy::dsl::operator-`

{{% interface %}}
----
namespace lexy
{
    struct minus_failure {};
}

namespace lexy::dsl
{
    constexpr _token-rule_ auto operator-(_token-rule_ auto token,
                                        _token-rule_ auto except);

[.lead]
`operator-` (minus) is a {{% token-rule %}} matches `token` unless `except` matches as well.

Matching::
  Matches and consumes `token`.
  Then tries to match `except` on a partial input that consists of everything just consumed by `token` (ignoring the trailing whitespace).
  Succeeds only if that fails to match the entire partial input.
Errors::
  * `lexy::minus_failure`: if `except` matches the entire partial input.
    Its range covers the partial input.
    The rule then fails.
  * All errors raised by matching `token`.
    The rule then fails.
Parse tree::
  Only a token node for `token` whose kind is determined by the minus rule; nothing for `except`.

{{% playground-example minus_any "Match words that don't start with `'no'`" %}}

{{% playground-example quoted "Match a string literal that doesn't contain control characters" %}}

CAUTION: When using `.error<Tag>` to override the generic `lexy::minus_failure` tag,
keep in mind that this also overrides all errors `token` might raise.

TIP: Use {{% docref "lexy::dsl::any" %}} to prevent the requirement that `except` must match the entire input as seen in the example.

NOTE: `token - a - b` is entirely equivalent to the {{% docref alternative %}} `token - (a / b)` and also optimized in the same way.
