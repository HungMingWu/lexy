== Token rule `lexy::dsl::eof`

{{% interface %}}

namespace lexy::dsl
{
    constexpr _token-rule_ auto eof;
}

[.lead]
`eof` is a {{% token-rule %}} that matches the end of input (EOF).

Matching::
  Succeeds if the reader is at the end of the input, without consuming anything.
Errors::
  {{% docref "lexy::expected_char_class" %}} (`"EOF"`): at the unchanged reader position.
Parse tree::
  Single token node whose range is empty with the {{% docref "lexy::predefined_token_kind" %}} `lexy::eof_token_kind`.

Parsing `eof` multiple times in sequence has no additional effect:
they all succeed if the first one succeeded and they all fail if the first one failed.

{{% playground-example eof "Match the empty input" %}}

{{% playground-example no_trailing "Prevent trailing characters" %}}

CAUTION: Without `eof`, `lexy` will happily match the prefix of an input only, ignoring any junk characters after it is finished.

NOTE: It does not skip whitespace before checking for EOF. Use {{% docref "whitespace" "`lexy::dsl::whitespace + eof`" %}} to do that.
