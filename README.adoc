`lexy` is a parser combinator library for {cpp}17 and onwards.
It allows you to write a parser by specifying it in a convenient {cpp} DSL,
which gives you all the flexibility and control of a handwritten parser without all the manual work.

== Features

Describe the parser, not some abstract grammar::
  Unlike parser generators that use some table driven magic for parsing, `lexy`'s grammar is just syntax sugar for a hand-written recursive descent parser.
  The parsing algorithm does exactly what you've instructed it to do.
  No more ambiguities or weird shift/reduce errors!

A pure {cpp} DSL::
  No need to use an external grammar file, embed the DSL directly in your {cpp} using operator overloading and functions.

No implicit backtracking or lookahead::
  It will only backtrack when you say it should, and only lookahead when and how far you want it.
  Don't worry about rules that have side-effects, they won't be executed unnecessarily thanks to the user-specified lookahead conditions.

Bring your own data structures::
  The input is parsed into the data structures you've provided.
  It will not do heap allocations to store output unless you've instructed it to do so.
  You can even evaluate the input on the fly, without storing anything.

Good error reporting::
  On a parse error, it will invoke a user-defined callback with information about what went wrong and during which production.
  Custom error messages can be injected using the special `dsl::error`, `dsl::require` and `dsl::prevent` error.
  Write parse rules that detect common mistakes and issue appropriate diagnostics!

Error recovery::
  Log an error, recover, and continue parsing! https://lexy.foonathan.net/playground/?example=recover[Try it online].

Unicode support::
  You can parse UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.
  `lexy` takes care of code point encoding and decoding as necessary, as well as endianness and byte-order marks.
  Want to match a string literal containing arbitrary Unicode code points or `\u21D4` and store the result in a `std::string`?
  You can do so out of the box.

Keyword and identifier parsing::
  Reserve a set of keywords that won't be matched as regular identifiers. https://lexy.foonathan.net/playground/?id=7boh7TGss[Try it online].

Tracing::
  Figure out why the grammar isn't working the way you want it to. https://lexy.foonathan.net/playground/?example=trace&mode=trace[Try it online].

Fully `constexpr` parsing::
  You want to parse a string literal at compile-time? You can do so.

Minimal standard library dependencies::
  The core parsing library only depends on the required headers such as `<type_traits>` or `<cstddef>`.
  Some input classes required `<cstdio>`.

Header-only core library::
  By necessity, not by choice -- it's `constexpr` after all.

== Planned features

The following features are in various stages of development and will be added before the 1.0.0 release.

Operator parsing::
  Parse operators with different precedences using Pratt parsing.

Byte parsing::
  Rules for parsing `N` bytes, an Nbit BE/LE integer, and related utilities for binary formats.

NOTE: `lexy` is under active development and especially currently undocumented features (such as the internal rule interface) are subject to change.
All breaking changes with migration strategies are documented in the change log and big breaks are announced in advance as an issue.

== FAQ

Why should I use `lexy` over XYZ?::
  `lexy` is closest to other PEG parsers.
  However, they usually do more implicit backtracking, which can hurt performance and you need to be very careful with rules that have side-effects.
  This is not the case for `lexy`, where backtracking is controlled using branch conditions.
  `lexy` also gives you a lot of control over error reporting and supports error recovery.

  http://boost-spirit.com/home/[Boost.Spirit]:::
    The main difference: it is not a Boost library.
    Otherwise, it is just a different implementation with a different flavor.
    Use `lexy` if you like `lexy` more.
  https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL[PEGTL]:::
    PEGTL is very similar and was a big inspiration.
    The biggest difference is that `lexy` uses an operator based DSL instead of inheriting from templated classes as PEGTL does;
    depending on your preference this can be an advantage or disadvantage.
  Handwritten Parsers:::
    Writing a handwritten parser is more manual work and error prone.
    `lexy` automates that away without having to sacrifice control.
    You can use it to quickly prototype a parser and then slowly replace more and more with a handwritten parser over time.

How bad are the compilation times?::
They're not as bad as you might expect (in debug mode, that is).
+
The example JSON parser compiles in about 2s on my machine.
If we remove all the lexy specific parts and just benchmark the time it takes for the compiler to process the datastructure (and stdlib includes),
that takes about 700ms.
If we validate JSON only instead of parsing it, so remove the data structures and keep only the lexy specific parts, we're looking at about 840ms.
+
Compile time benchmarks and optimizations are planned.
Keep in mind, that you can fully isolate `lexy` in a single translation unit that only needs to be touched when you change the parser.

How bad are the {cpp} error messages if you mess something up?::
  They're certainly worse than the error message `lexy` gives you.
  The big problem here is that the first line gives you the error, followed by dozens of template instantiations, which end at your `lexy::parse` call.
  Besides providing an external tool to filter those error messages, there is nothing I can do about that.

How fast is it?::
  Benchmarks are available in the `benchmarks/` directory.
  A sample result of the JSON validator benchmark which compares the example JSON parser with various other implementations is available https://lexy.foonathan.net/benchmark_json/[here].

Why is it called lexy?::
  I previously had a tokenizer library called `foonathan/lex`.
  I've tried adding a parser to it, but found that the line between pure tokenization and parsing has become increasingly blurred.
  `lexy` is a re-imagination on of the parser I've added to `foonathan/lex`, and I've simply kept a similar name.

== Building

The library uses CMake as its build system.
Simply put it somewhere and use `add_subdirectory()` to make the following targets available

`foonathan::lexy::core`::
  This target is required.
  It is an `INTERFACE` target that sets the required include path and {cpp} standard flags.
`foonathan::lexy::file`::
  Link to this library if you want to use the (not header only) `lexy::read_file()` functionality.
`foonathan::lexy::unicode`::
  Link to this library if you want to use advanced Unicode rules that require the Unicode character database.
`foonathan::lexy::ext`::
  Link to this library if you want to use the extension headers in `lexy_ext/`.
`foonathan::lexy`::
  Umbrella target that links to all other targets.

Configuration is supported by providing a `lexy_user_config.hpp` somewhere in the include search path,
or setting the `LEXY_USER_CONFIG_HEADER` CMake option to a header path.
This header can then override many of the detections in `lexy/_detail/config.hpp`.
Refer to that header for details.

The library is continuously tested on GCC 7 or higher, clang 6 or higher, as well as MSVC and clang-cl.
It requires {cpp}17 support, but works best with {cpp}20.
